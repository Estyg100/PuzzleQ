This repo is for the software implementation of the game of PuzzleQ. A description of the game is provided below.

## The Game
The player is presented with a 3x3 grid of empty spots. When the player presses start, all spots except for one will be filled with a random part of a photo. The photos will then be able to be manipulated and moved around to create one big picture. Once the player has successfully placed all the parts of the photo in the right spot, the player wins.
