        The player is presented with a 3x3 grid of empty spots. When the player presses start, all spots except
        for one will be filled with a random part of a photo. The photos will then be able to be manipulated and
        moved around to create one big picture. Once the player has successfully placed all the parts of the
        photo in the right spot, the player wins.
